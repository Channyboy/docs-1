= server start command

Starts the named Liberty server as a Windows service (Windows only).


== Syntax

Run the command from `path_to_liberty/wlp/bin`.

----
server registerWinService serverName
----

serverName::
The name of the server to run the command against. If no server is specified, a server called `defaultServer` is automatically created to run the command against.

The Windows service name and Windows service display name is `serverName`. After you register, you can find and administer the Liberty server as a service by using `regedit` from the Windows Registry program. Entries for the service in the registry are in the following locations:

----
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->SOFTWARE->Wow6432Node->Apache Software Foundation->Procrun 2.0->serverName
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->SYSTEM->CurrentControlSet->services->serverName
----


== Options
// Only include options relevant to the command and with text relevant to the command; eg don't talk about dump archives in the 'server package' article. Some commands don't have any relevant options - should this section just not be here when it has no content?

There are no optional parameters for this command.

== Usage

Start `myserver` server in the background:

----
server start myserver
----

== Usage examples

To start or stop a server by using the server script on Windows systems:

----
server.bat start serverName
server.bat stop serverName
----
