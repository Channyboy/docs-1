= JSON-B for serializing and deserializing Java objects

JSON-B is a standard binding layer for converting Java objects. It defines a default mapping algorithm for converting existing Java classes to JSON messages.

== Introduction to JSON-B

*Placeholder text* Why is JSON-B important? Cloud-native is an industry-wide approach to developing and rapidly deploying applications to the cloud at scale. Cloud-native applications are designed around team-aligned microservices and developed by using agile practices and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) to streamline deployment. With a range of vendors providing cloud platforms, open source and open standards are essential enablers for avoiding vendor lock-in.

== Why JSON-B out performs JSON-P

*Placeholder text* Microservice architecture is a popular approach for building cloud-native applications so that each component is an individual service that fulfills a specific purpose. It enables small, autonomous teams to develop, deploy, and scale their respective services independently. One benefit is that the application can be scaled on a more granular level because each service is built and managed independently. The high-traffic services can be individually scaled to efficiently use resources rather than scaling up the entire system. Another benefit is that failures in one service can be isolated from the rest of the system; if a service fails, services that are independent are unaffected while dependent services can employ fault tolerance strategies to prevent the failure from cascading to other services.

== Examples of JSON-B in action 

=== Add Maven repositories
Add these repositories to your Maven project first:
----
<repositories>
    <!-- Needed for JSON-B API -->
    <repository>
        <id>java.net-Public</id>
        <name>Maven Java Net Snapshots and Releases</name>
        <url>https://maven.java.net/content/groups/public/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

=== Add some dependencies
Now, add these dependencies to the repository that you created: 
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.json.bind</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.json.bind-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
                    
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse</groupId>
    <artifactId>yasson</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.json</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Map an object
The main JSON-B entry point is `Jsonb` class. It provides all necessary methods to serialize and deserialize Java objects. `Jsonb` instances are thread safe. They can be cached and reused.  
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.json.bind</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.json.bind-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
                    
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse</groupId>
    <artifactId>yasson</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.json</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Map a collection
JSON-B supports collections and generic collections handling. For proper deserialization the runtime type of resulting object needs to be passed to JSON-B during deserialization. It can be done a way shown below. 
----
// List of dogs
List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<>();
dogs.add(falco);
dogs.add(cassidy);

// Create Jsonb and serialize
Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();
String result = jsonb.toJson(dogs);

// Deserialize back
dogs = jsonb.fromJson(result, new ArrayList<Dog>(){}.getClass().getGenericSuperclass());
----

=== Customize mappings
You can customize mappings in lots of different ways. You can use JSON-B annotations for compile time customizations and JsonbConfig class for runtime customizations. The following sample includes the creation of a custom configuration that serializes null values. By default, class properties with null values are ignored. 
----
// Create custom configuration
JsonbConfig nillableConfig = new JsonbConfig().withNullValues(true);

// Create Jsonb with custom configuration
Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create(nillableConfig);

// Use it!
String result = jsonb.toJson(pojo);
----
