= JSON-B for serializing and deserializing Java objects

JSON-B is a standard binding layer for converting Java objects. It defines a default mapping algorithm for converting existing Java classes to JSON messages.

== Introduction to JSON-B

*Placeholder text* Why is JSON-B important? Cloud-native is an industry-wide approach to developing and rapidly deploying applications to the cloud at scale. Cloud-native applications are designed around team-aligned microservices and developed by using agile practices and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) to streamline deployment. With a range of vendors providing cloud platforms, open source and open standards are essential enablers for avoiding vendor lock-in.

MicroProfile enables you to develop and deploy cloud-native Java applications as loosely-coupled, lightweight services, each representing one unique business function. This approach is modular and makes the application easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to test, and easy to maintain.

== Why JSON-B out performs JSON-P

*Placeholder text* Microservice architecture is a popular approach for building cloud-native applications so that each component is an individual service that fulfills a specific purpose. It enables small, autonomous teams to develop, deploy, and scale their respective services independently. One benefit is that the application can be scaled on a more granular level because each service is built and managed independently. The high-traffic services can be individually scaled to efficiently use resources rather than scaling up the entire system. Another benefit is that failures in one service can be isolated from the rest of the system; if a service fails, services that are independent are unaffected while dependent services can employ fault tolerance strategies to prevent the failure from cascading to other services.
