= Automated certificate management with ACME 

The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol automates the process of certificate verification and issuance. You can use the acmeCA client feature to automatically get a browser-trusted certificate for your Open Liberty server from an ACME certificate authority (CA).

Clients use certificates to authenticate domain names on a server. These certificates verify that the server legitimately controls a domain and protect clients from man-in-the-middle attacks. The certificate is a record that server control over a domain is tested and verified by a CA. To get a certificate, the server must generate a certificate signing request (CSR) and respond to several challenges from the certificate authority. These challenges prove the server controls the domain that is being verified.

In the past, certificate issuance required significant human involvement. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-18[The ACME protocol] standardizes the process so that it can be carried out between an automated certificate management agent on the server and an ACME CA, such as https://letsencrypt.org/[LetsEncryptCA].

== ACME and Open Liberty

The acmeCA client feature (link pending) can request certificates and respond to challenges from the CA. The feature can also manage certificate renewals and revocations.

When an Open Liberty server starts with transport layer security (TLS) enabled, a self-signed server certificate is created for the server. This certificate can be used for testing and development purposes. However, since the certificate isn't signed by a CA, clients that connect to the server over TLS don't trust it. Browsers then require clients to confirm whether they trust the server, which can cause problems for containerized environments and microservices, even during testing and development.

To avoid problems with self-signed certificates, services such as LetsEncrypt use the ACME protocol to provide free CA-signed certificates over the public web. When the acmeCA client feature is enabled, the Open Liberty server automatically requests a certificate from your configured CA provider at startup if a new certificate is needed.

=== Acme CA Account management

The acmeCA client feature requires a valid account with an ACME CA. Account details are stored in an account key file. Before a CSR is issued, the feature first checks for an existing account key file. If no account key file exists, the feature generates a new one. This file is then used to either register a new account or log in to an existing account. Like any security credential, the account key file must be backed up and protected.

You can request a new account private key at any time by using the REST API. Renewing a private key might be necessary if your existing key is compromised, or as a periodic security precaution. To renew the account private key, a user that is in the administrator role can send the following HTTPS request:

[source,command]
----
curl -kv https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca/account -X post -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"operation":"renewAccountKeyPair"}'
----

Some certificate authorities provide terms of service. If an ACME CA modifies its terms of service, you might be required to agree to the new terms manually. If you fail to agree to the modified terms of service, the ACME CA server might refuse any future requests from your account until you confirm your agreement. To avoid service interruption, provide an account contact in your ACME configuration that specifies a monitored email address.

=== Certificate renewal and revocation

You can configure the acmeCA client feature to automatically renew any expiring or revoked certificates. The `renewBeforeExpiration` property specifies the amount of time before a certificate expires that the server requests a new certificate.

When the server starts, it checks the expiration date on the CA-signed certificate. If the expiration date is within the specified range of time, or if the certificate is already expired or revoked, the server automatically requests a new certificate. While the server is running, it checks the certificate daily and automatically renews any expiring or revoked certificate. If a renew request fails, the background process continues to request a new certificate hourly until the request is successful. For more information, see the acmeCA client feature (link pending).

Runtime changes to the acmeCA configuration can trigger an automatic certificate renewal request. For example, if the directory URI is changed to a different endpoint, the server requests a new certificate.

You can also choose to manually renew the active certificate. To renew the active certificate, a user that is in the administrator role can send the following HTTPS request:

[source,command]
----
curl -kv https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca/certificate -X POST -u admin:password -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"operation":"renewCertificate"}'
----

The certificate that is replaced is revoked automatically after the new certificate is installed. When a certificate is renewed, new connections use the new certificate. Existing connections are not interrupted.

You might need to revoke a certificate before you retire a server, during testing, or before you move from one ACME CA to another. To revoke a certificate, a user that is in the administrator role can send the following HTTPS request:

[source,command]
----
curl -kv https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca/certificate -X POST -u admin:password -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"operation":"revokeCertificate","reason":"key_compromise"}'
----

You can specify a revocation reason by using the reason key-value pair. The following reason values are valid:

* `unspecified`
* `key_compromise`
* `ca_compromise`
* `affiliation_changed`
* `superseded`
* `cessation_of_operations`
* `certificate_hold`
* `remove_from_crl`
* `privilege_withdrawn`
* `aa_compromise`

If you don't specify a reason, the default value is `unspecified`.

=== HTTPS monitoring

The active ACME CA account and active certificates can be monitored by issuing HTTPS requests. The content returned from these HTTPS endpoints is for informational purposes only and should not be utilized or depended on problematically.

To view both the active ACME CA account and active certificate at the same time, you can issue the following HTTPS request with a user that possesses either the administrator or reader roles:

curl -kv https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca -X GET -u admin:password
To view only the active account, issue the following HTTPS request with a user that possesses either the administrator or reader roles:

curl -kv https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca/account -X GET -u admin:password
To view only the active certificate, issue the following HTTPS request with a user that possesses either the administrator or reader roles:

curl -kv https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca/certificate -X GET -u admin:password
Or access the REST endpoint using a browser and provide administrator or reader role credentials:

 https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca
https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca/account
https://mydomain.com:443/ibm/api/acmeca/certificate


== Troubleshooting

You can enable trace by using the following trace specification:  `ACME=all` Optionally add Transport security trace, `com.ibm.ws.ssl.*=all`

=== CWPKI2058W warning
The following warning occurs: ` CWPKI2058W: Certificate revocation status checking ignored soft failures. Revocation checking might be incomplete. The failures are: '[java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Unable to determine revocation status due to network error, java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Unable to determine revocation status due to network error]'.`

If you see this network error warning and you are running with a test CA server, such as https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder[Boulder], you can add a custom `ocspResponderUrl` or you can disable revocation testing if the test CA does not support revocation testing. See the `Tips for using a  local or test Certificate Authority` for examples.

=== Slow server startup
As part of the ACME protocol, there is remote communication in some calls to the configured CA, which can cause a perceived delay in server startup if the server fetches a new certification. If the CA provider is not accessible or is slow to respond, the Open Liberty server startup is delayed.

For example, some CA providers can take 10-20 seconds to complete a certificate request. A certificate request only occurs if a certificate is required. The following conditions can result in a new certificate request:

- initial certificate request
- expired certificate
-  certificate is about to expire according to the `renewBeforeExpiration` property
-  revoked certificate
- some configuration changes

=== Certificate request times out
If ordering the certificate and processing the certificate challenge times out, you can set a longer timeout value by using the  `challengePollTimeout` and `orderPollTimeout` properties.

=== Received an HTTP code 429 on a renew request
To prevent too many immediate certificate renew requests and a possible negative impact on the server, there is a small window of time where certificate renew requests are blocked. Once this expires, new requests can be made. The 429 message indicates when new requests can be made.

=== Received a `rate limit exceeded` message
Some CA, such as LetsEncrypt, enforce a rate limit on requesting new certificates. If you are testing and request several certificates in a short amount of time, use an appropriate testing server. For example, LetsEncrypt provides a staging server with higher rate limits.

=== The certificate is renewed at startup when it isn't expired
If the certificate is marked as revoked, it is automatically renewed. If the certificate is expiring, it is renewed. The expiring window is calculated by the expiration date minus the value of the renewBeforeExpiration property. By default, a certification is marked as expiring 7 days before the expiration of the certificate.

The directory URI, the domain or other account information was changed and a new certificate is required.

If the server starts with the `--clean` option, historical information on the certificate is removed and the server requests a new certificate.

=== After a failure to fetch the certificate, the keystore produces errors
If the server cannot fetch a certificate, a keystore is still created. There is a fixed Java bug where an empty keystore file causes an exception. Examples of this error include:
```
CWPKI2030E: The ACME service could not install a certificate under the default alias into the defaultKeyStore keystore. The error is 'The keystore [defaultKeyStore] is not present in the configuration'.```
```
CWWKS9582E: The [defaultSSLConfig] sslRef attributes required by the orb element with the defaultOrb id have not been resolved within 10 seconds. As a result, the applications will not start. Ensure that you have included a keyStore element and that Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is configured correctly. If the sslRef is defaultSSLConfig, then add a keyStore element with the id defaultKeyStore and a password.
```
To resolve, remove the empty keystore. Update to a Java level that includes the fix to allow empty key stores (See Java bug IJ19292).

=== Failed to fetch certificate: CWPKI2001E
```
CWPKI0804E: SSL certificate creation error. The error is: CWPKI2001E: The ACME certificate authority at the http://my-configured-ca.com/directory URI responded that the authorization challenge failed for the mydomainname.com domain. The challenge status is INVALID.  The error is 'Fetching http://mydomainname.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/FXCFcGCv4Ov2ofJ2i-PgMsO1kECwKB0XfTzsPjNIXBs: Connection refused'.
```
Verify that the provided domain name is accessible by the CA. Review the logs and confirm that the expected domain name or IP address is used for the acme-challenge web application.

```
CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://mydomainname.com:80/.well-known/acme-challenge/
```

To configure the host name used for web applications, add or update the `host` attribute for the `httpEndpoint` configuration.
