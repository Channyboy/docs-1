= Logstash collector events reference list


You can use the xref:reference:logstashCollector-1.0.adoc[Logstash collector feature] to send log events to a remote Logstash server so that you can manage and visualize them with products such as Elasticsearch and Kibana. Each type of log event has its own set of fields that you can use to customize your Kibana dashboard.

If your Open Liberty server is deployed in an environment that manages your logs, such as a Kubernetes cluster, the managing agent can transfer your log data to Logstash. However, some server configurations cannot use an external agent to manage log data. In these cases, you can use the Open Liberty Logstash collector feature to internally collect your log data at run time and send it to a Logstash server. For more information, see xref:forwarding-logs-logstash.adoc[Forwarding logs and events to Logstash with Logstash collector].

The Logstash collector feature captures log events at run time, breaks them into fields, and securely forwards them to the configured Logstash log collection server. You can configure the feature to send one or more of the following types of data:


- <<Message events,Message log events>>
- <<Trace events,Trace log events>>
- <<HTTP access log events,HTTP access log events>> from the Open Liberty server
- <<FFDC events,First failure data capture (FFDC) log events>>
- <<Garbage collection events,Garbage collection events>> for IBM JDKs
- <<Audit events,Audit events>>


== Event types

The Logstash collector feature sends each event as a set of field name-value pairs. In addition to a set of common fields that are available for all event types, each type of event has its own unique fields. These fields are useful when you xref:forwarding-logs-logstash.adoc[create your own Kibana dashboards].

In addition to the default log and trace framework, the Logstash collector feature forwards message events and trace events when binary logging is enabled.
For more information about log event types, see xref:log-management.adoc[Log management].

== Server and host names in virtualized environments

When Open Liberty servers are running in Docker containers or other virtualized environments, the `hostName` and `serverName` fields are automatically set according to certain variables in the configuration.

The `hostName` field is set to the first of the following values that is available:

- The value of the `CONTAINER_HOST` environment variable
- The value of the `${defaultHostName}` Open Liberty configuration variable
- The canonical hostname as reported by the JDK

The `serverName` field is set to the first of the following values that is available:

- The value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable
- The value of the `${wlp.server.name}` Open Liberty configuration variable


When Open Liberty servers run in Docker containers or other virtual environments that you manage, set the `CONTAINER_HOST` and `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variables when you run your image. These environment variables ensure that the Logstash collector feature tags the records that it sends with the appropriate host and container name, which aids in problem determination. If you do not set these environment variables, you might find it difficult to determine which container sent which events when you use a dashboard that shows events from multiple containers.

When you start a Docker container, use a command similar to the following example to set these environment variables:

[source,command]
----
docker run -d -e LICENSE=accept -e CONTAINER_NAME=yourContainerName -e CONTAINER_HOST=yourContainerHost --name=yourContainerName yourImageName
----

When Open Liberty servers run in the IBM CloudÂ® Kubernetes Service, the `CONTAINER_HOST` and `CONTAINER_NAME` are already set for you.
