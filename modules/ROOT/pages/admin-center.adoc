= Manage Open Liberty from a web browser with Admin Center

The Admin Center is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for Open Liberty servers. You can use the Admin Center to manage and monitor your server configuration, Open ID Connect permissions, and Java batch jobs.

== Admin Center setup

To use the Admin Center, you must enable the feature:adminCenter[display=Admin Center feature] in your `server.xml` file and https://www.openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/appSecurity-3.0.html#_configure_rest_api_access_roles[configure a management role] for either the reader or administrator role. Furthermore, because Admin Center is only accessible over HTTPS, you must specify an HTTPS port and configure a keystore to protect `keystore` files that contain server authentication credentials.

You can use the following example `server.xml` file to try out Admin Center. This example enables the `adminCenter-1.0` feature and configures a https://www.openliberty.io/docs/latest/user-registries-application-security.html#_basic_user_registries_for_application_development[basic user registry] that defines users in the `reader-role` and `administrator-role` management roles. It also specifies an HTTPS port in the `httpEndpoint` element and a default keystore and password reference in the `keyStore` element:

[source,xml]
----
<server description="Admin Center example server">
   <!-- Enable features -->
   <featureManager>
      <feature>adminCenter-1.0</feature>
   </featureManager>
   <!-- Define two users-->
   <basicRegistry id="basic">
      <user name="admin" password="adminpwd" />
      <user name="reader" password="readerpwd" />
   </basicRegistry>
   <!-- A user with the administrator-role has full access to the Admin Center -->
   <administrator-role>
      <user>admin</user>
   </administrator-role>
   <!-- A user with the reader-role has read-only access to the Admin Center -->
   <reader-role>
      <user>reader</user>
   </reader-role>
   <!-- To protect keystore files that have server authentication credentials, define a keystore and assign it a password -->
   <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="Liberty" />
   <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
                 host="*"
                 httpPort="9080"
                 httpsPort="9443" />
</server>
----

== Admin Center login

To access the Admin Center GUI, make sure that your server is running and point a web browser at the Admin Center login page:

`https://host_name:port_number/adminCenter/`

For the `host_name` value, specify the IP address or domain name server (DNS) hostname of the computer on which the Open Liberty server is running. If the browser is running on the same computer as the server, you can specify `localhost`.
For the `port_number` value, specify the `httpsPort` value from the `httpEndpoint` element in your `server.xml` file.

For example, if your browser is running on the same computer as your server and you use the previous example `server.xml` configuration, Admin Center is accessible from the following URL:

`https://localhost:9443/adminCenter/`

If your browser prompts you to confirm that the connection is trusted, specify an exception or otherwise enable the connection to continue to Admin Center.
To log in to Admin Center, specify the username and password from your management role configuration. For example, if you use the previously provided example `server.xml` configuration, specify the _admin_ username  and the _adminpwd_ password.

The following screen capture shows the Admin Center login screen:

== The Toolbox

After you log in to Admin Center, the browser displays the Toolbox, which contains tools such as the **Server Config** and **Explore** tools and a bookmark to link:https://openliberty.io[openliberty.io]. The following screen capture shows the Admin Center Toolbox:

image::ui_toolbox.png[align="center"]

The **Server Config** and **Explore** tools are available by default. The **Java Batch** and **Open ID Connect** tools are available only if you enable and configure the respective Open Liberty features for those functions. You can add or remove tools from the Toolbox by selecting the **Edit** icon. To use a tool, select its Toolbox icon.

The following tools are available from the Admin Center:

* <<#server,Server Config>>
* <<#explore,Explore>>
* <<#batch,Java Batch>>
* <<#openid,OpenId Connect>>

[#server]
=== The Server Config tool

You can use the **Server Config** tool to view and edit Open Liberty server configuration files.
To edit configuration files, you must be in the `administrator-role` management role.

Before you can edit configuration files, the tool prompts you to add a link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/remoteFileAccess.html[remoteFileAccess] element to your `server.xml` file. You can copy the example element from the browser window or configure it  manually. If you do not add this element, configuration files are shown in read-only mode.

To enable write access to configuration files, add the following code to your `server.xml` file:
[source, xml]
----
<remoteFileAccess>
   <writeDir>${server.config.dir}</writeDir>
</remoteFileAccess>
----

The **Server Config** tool displays configuration files, such as a `server.xml` file, in two modes: **Design** and **Source**. Each of these modes can be accessed from a browser tab within the tool. You can customize these modes by clicking the **Settings** icon. For example, you can add or remove parameter descriptions in **Design** mode or add or remove line numbers in **Source** mode.

The **Design** mode displays the content of configuration files by using graphical controls with inline documentation. In this mode, select elements in the configuration to see enabled features and parameter settings.

The **Source** mode enables direct access to edit the file text and provides tooltip descriptions for file elements. Hover on elements and parameters to view their documentation. You can press Ctrl+Space to use content assist, which helps you add new elements, parameters, and values.

The following screen capture shows the Design tab of the **Server Config** tool:

[#explore]
=== The Explore tool
You can use the **Explore** tool to monitor and manage Open Liberty resources. This tool offers options to view information about the server and its applications. You can also use it to stop, start, or restart resources.

You can use the **Applications** view on the vertical navigation bar to monitor, stop, start, or restart applications that are running on your server.

The **Monitor** view on the vertical navigation bar shows server and system metrics graphically in charts. You can use the Monitor view to track heap memory, loaded classes, active Java virtual machine (JVM) threads, and central processing unit (CPU) usage. The following screen capture shows the **Monitor** view of the **Explore** tool:

image::ui_exploreTool3.png[monitor view of explore tool,align="center"]

You can add more resource metrics to the **Monitor** view by selecting the **Edit** icon and choosing from the menu. When the feature:monitor[display=Performance Monitoring] feature is enabled, more resource metrics are available from this menu. Depending on what resources are configured for the server, the following resource metrics might be available:

- Active Sessions
- Active Liberty Threads
- Average Response Time
- Average Wait Time
- Request Count
- Used Connections

[#batch]
=== The Java Batch tool

If you configure the feature:batchManagement[display=Batch Management] feature, you can access the **Java Batch** tool. With this tool, you can view the progress and status of your Java batch jobs, manage their instances, and view their log files. The following screen capture shows the **Java Batch** tool:

image::ui_javaBatchTool.png[align="center"]

To view details about a batch job in the **Explore** tool, hover over the **Batch Job Name**. Each batch job has an **Actions** icon, which you can select to stop, restart, or purge the job, and a **View Logs** icon, which you can select to view the job logs.

If batch jobs or job logs are on remote servers, link:/guides/cors.html[configure cross origin region sharing (CORS)] on each remote server. CORS enables Admin Center to request job information from remote servers.



[#openid]
=== The OpenID Connect (OIDC) tools

If you enable the feature:openidConnectServer[display=OpenID Connect Provider feature] and link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/09/13/microprofile-reactive-messaging-19009.html#oidc[configure OpenID Connect], you can access the following **OpenID Connect** tools from the Admin Center:

* **OpenID Connect Client Management**:
You can use this tool to allow an administrator to manage clients on an OpenID Connect provider.

* **OpenID Connect Personal Token Management**:
You can use this tool to allow a user to manage application passwords and application tokens on an OpenID Connect provider.

* **OpenID Connect Users Token Management**:
You can use this tool to allow an administrator to revoke application passwords and app-tokens of other users on an OpenID Connect provider.
