MicroProfile metrics provides a `/metrics` endpoint from which you can access all metrics that are emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications.
When the application runs, you can view your metrics from any browser by accessing the endpoint.

MicroProfile Metrics 2.3 explicitly enables the feature:monitor-1.0[display=Performance Monitoring] feature.
In previous versions of MicroProfile Metrics, the Performance Monitoring feature had to be independently configured in the `server.xml` file. 
By enabling the Performance Monitoring feature, MicroProfile Metrics provides access to metrics about server components.
