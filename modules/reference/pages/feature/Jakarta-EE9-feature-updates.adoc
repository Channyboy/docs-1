= Jakarta EE9 feature updates

For Jakarta EE 9 applications to run in Open Liberty, new Jakarta EE 9 features must be specified in the server configuration. If an old name is incorrectly used with a new Jakarta EE 9 version, the server does not start, and the server logs provide information to say which new feature name must be used.

In many cases, the new Jakarta EE 9 features use the same short names as the corresponding Jakarta EE 8 features. In those cases, the Jakarta EE 9 features simply have an updated feature version.
For example, `cdi-2.0` was updated to `cdi-3.0`.

However, in some cases, the feature short name is also different, as with `ejb-3.2`, which was updated to `enterpriseBeans-4.0`.
For example, if `ejb-3.2` is incorrectly changed to `ejb-4.0`, the server logs indicate that `enterpriseBeans-4.0` must be used.


The following table lists features for which only the feature version is updated:

Currently, the transformer cannot update Open Liberty features because it is missing rules data to specify the updates. Features must be updated manually or by custom code.
