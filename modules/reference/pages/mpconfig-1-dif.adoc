There are 2 key sets of changes which may impact any existing configuration when upgrading from mpConfig 1.x->2.0:

== SmallRye's implementation of the specification

1-  OpenLiberty implements the MicroProfile Config specification to allow application configuration from different locations (ConfigSources).
In the previous versions, OpenLiberty implemented the specification in its own codebase.
However, for MicroProfile Config 2.0 it consumes SmallRye's implementation of the specification.
This means that any mpConfig functionality that OL implemented beyond the scope of the specification will be lost from 1.x->2.0.


- Converters for the AtomicInteger and AtomicLong properties are no longer provided, because these properties are not widely used. 
Converting an injected value to one of these types of properties it may throw the following exception: `SRCFG02006: The property <yourProperty> cannot be converted to class java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger/AtomicLong`.
If you need to convert a string to AtomicInteger to AntomicLong, you can convert to Integer or Long and then create an AtomicIneger or AtomicLong.
Alternatively, you can create your own converter for AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.

- In mpConfig 2.0, caching is discontinued.
  Values looked up from Config are no longer cached.

In mpConfig 1.x, requests made for the same config key for a duration up to five seconds returned the same object without calling the config sources.


- When conversion to a type is needed and a converter for that type is not available, converters for subtypes of that type will no longer be used.
For example, in mpConfig-1.x if a converter was registered for type Dog (which extends Animal), then a type Animal variable was injected which used the Dog converter, e.g.

@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "DOG_KEY")
Animal myAnimal;

The recommended approach is to use the above converter to convert to Dog, which is efficiently an Animal.

2- Changes in the mpConfig specification from 1.4->2.0 introduced some incompatibility changes.
Some of these changes are by-products of new features, and others are intentional specification clarifications and changes.

- ConfigSource.getPropertyNames() is no longer a default method provided by the specification.
Any custom Config Sources which use this method will need to implement the method, otherwise a java.lang.AbstractMethodError will be thrown.

- Property Expression is a new feature which may impact existing configurations.
From mpConfig 2.0 Config Properties can include references to other Config Properties by using the following syntax: ${anotherConfigPropertyNameâ€‹}.
As such, any Config Properties which contain values with Property Expression syntax may behave differently.

- Config Property value conversion rules have been updated such that the empty value and other special characters are no longer valid values for particular return types.
Attempting to call getValue() on an injected empty value ("") for type String for example will throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException
