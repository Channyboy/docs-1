The `auditUtility auditReader` command decrypts and unsigns an audit log that is encrypted, signed, or both.
The command must specify the location of the audit log to be read as well as location of the output file.

== Usage examples

Specify the fully qualified location of the audit log to decrypt.

----
auditUtility auditReader
  --auditFileLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/logs/audit.log
----

Specify the fully qualified location of the resulting output log.

----
auditUtility auditReader
  --outputFilelocation=c:/decryptedAuditLogs/decrypted_audit.log
----

Specify that the audit log is encrypted by setting the value to `true`.

----
auditUtility auditReader --encrypted=true
----

Specify the fully-qualified file location of the keystore which stores the certificate used to decrypt the audit records.

----
auditUtility auditReader --encKeyStoreLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/mykeystore.jks
----

Specify the password for the keystore that contains the certificate that is used to decrypt the audit records.

----
auditUtility auditReader --encKeyStorePassword=libertypwd
----

Specify the type of the encryption keystore as `PKCS12`.

----
auditUtility auditReader --encKeyStoreType=PKCS12
----

Specify the fully qualified location of the audit log to unsign.
----
auditUtility auditReader --auditFileLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/logs/audit.log
----

Specify the fully qualified location of the resulting output log.
----
auditUtility auditReader --outputFilelocation=c:/unsignedAuditLogs/unsigned_audit.log
----

Specify that the audit log is signed by setting the value to `true`.

----
auditUtility auditReader --signed=true
----
----
auditUtility auditReader --signingKeyStoreLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/mySiginingKeystore.PKCS12
----
----
auditUtility auditReader --signingKeyStorePassword=libertypwd
----
----
auditUtility auditReader --signingKeyStoreType=PKCS12
----
